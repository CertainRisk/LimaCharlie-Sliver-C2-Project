## Configuring LimaCharlie

    Shipping Sysmon event logs alongside EDR telemetry.

- Some information will be redundant to LimaCharlie's own telemetry but Sysmon is a very powerful visibility tool that runs well alongside and EDR agent. 

## Using SSH Client to Access Ubuntu VM

    Accessing via built-in command prompt on host machine.

## Observing EDR Telemetry in LimaCharlie

    Identifying malicious processes and activities.

To spot an evil process, you must look for ones that are not signed. 
- While some signed can be malicious, they often are not.

- I can see the LimaCharlie rphcp.exe
- I can see a lot of the open Python3 web servers
- Then I see the C2 Payload, which I accidently executed twice.

Navigated to the location where the payload was known to have been downloaded

- It not being found doesn't make it innocent. We just generated this payload ourselves so it hasn't been found or known to VT yet.
- Nearly everything has already been seen by VT, so this would be a suspicious finding!

## Response to Credential Dumping

    Detecting and responding to sensitive process access.

Had to relaunch the payload in administrative powershell mode (even though I already did) and was able to get the Enabled SeDebugPriviledge

Now I am going to drop the lsass.exe from memory and save it locally on the Sliver C2 server.

## Building Detection and Response Rules

    Crafting rules for events like sensitive process access and shadow copies deletion.
- lsass.exe is known sensitive process targeted by credential dumping tools so we should find them in the EDR.
- Drilling into the Timeline of the Windows VM sensor:
- I am going to use the Event Type Filters to filter for sensitive_process_access

Telling it to look at SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS events where the victim or target process ends with lsass.exe

LimaCharlie allows for testing of the logic, which we will do in this Target Event section.

## Blocking Attacks!
Must always properly baseline the environment for false positives else you could cause issues with your environment. 


Volume Shadow Copies provide a convenient way to restore individual files or even an entire file system. It is often used for recovering from ransomware attacks. For this reason, itâ€™s become very predictable that one of the first signs of an impending ransomware attack is the deletion of volume shadow copies. 

Getting back to the SSH session, we will launch a shell via Sliver with "shell"
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/LimaCharlie-Sliver-C2-Project/assets/141761181/33e43c23-f311-4013-873d-ada8a9ad2134)

We will run the command vssadmin delete shadows /all
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/LimaCharlie-Sliver-C2-Project/assets/141761181/f9b00c6f-fb29-4270-bf44-512c2375b09b)

LimaCharlie picked up on the Shadow Copies Deletion Using OS utilities.

It even provides references!
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/LimaCharlie-Sliver-C2-Project/assets/141761181/6413d9d4-2725-40ef-97e7-ad6cc1cd7fde)

Let's craft a D&R response to the already formatted rule for this event! 
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/LimaCharlie-Sliver-C2-Project/assets/141761181/96e586e1-ac43-42bc-a969-1e1b4fbbffc4)

Time to try it in the wild. 
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/LimaCharlie-Sliver-C2-Project/assets/141761181/97f3d9c7-1405-4995-9ea2-2c28b7d5edad)

If our rule worked, the system shell will hang and fail to return anything and shut down, which it did!

## Handling False Positives

    Crafting rules to limit false detections.

## Advanced EDR Capabilities

    Adding YARA signatures for malware detection.
